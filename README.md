TimedBroadcasts allows server owners to broadcast a custom message with a custom delay throughout their server. Both the message and the delay between messages can be customised in the config.yml file.

To change the announcement messeage, replace the message in double quotes with your desired message. 
To change the delay time between message, replace the number in single quotes with a different number representing the amount of seconds you would like in between messages.
